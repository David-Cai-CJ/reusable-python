# Tutorial Setup

Before the tutorial you should...

* download and install the trial version of text editor [sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
* download an [Anaconda3 installer file](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for your system.
* [Install Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install) under your user account home directory
* Download the tutorial materials from [github.com/vestuto/reusable-python](github.com/vestuto/reusable-python), either as a ZIP or using git. Unzip if needed.
* Locate the `check_version.py` script found in the downloaded course content.
* Open a terminal or command-prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `check_version.py` script, and run it as follows: `python ./check_version.py` 
* download but do NOT install the [Miniconda3 installer file](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) for Python3 (~25 MB).

Notes:

* We will install Miniconda to a custom/secondary directory as a student exercise in class, so ***ALL*** students need the installer file, even those that already have e.g. Anaconda/Miniconda installed. I will provide uninstall instructions as part of the course material
* We will also create conda environments as a student exercise, so no need to do so before hand.
* One week before the tutorial, get the latest version of the course content by downloading ZIP, cloning the project, of "git pull" content
