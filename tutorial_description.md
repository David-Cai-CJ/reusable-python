# Tutorial Description

## Course Title: 

"Introduction to Reusable Python"

## Course Abstract:

Learn how to organize your python code into reusable units such as containers, functions, modules, and packages; and then use of pip and conda, to install and reuse locally, and to distribute and reuse globally.

## Course Description

This tutorial introduces the basics of organizing and sharing your python code for reuse through a series of student exercises that build on each other. The content is intentionally limited to the core aspects of python scope, modules, packaging, pip, and conda needed to get you started writing reusable code and contributing to the shared ecosystem of reusable scientific python software.

We start with a python terminal session, save the history to a script, and organize that script using containers and functions. Then we create a python module that we import or run as a script, explore some aspects of scope, create a python package, and write a setup.py to install the package. Next, we introduce conda for managing environments and packages. We go on to write a conda recipe for our python package, and use conda-build to create a conda package from our recipe. Finally we install our conda package locally and upload it to conda-forge.

## Intended Audience

Intermediate 

*If you are a beginner in python, but very comfortable with use of the terminal (Linux or Mac) or command prompt (Windows), including setting and changing environment variables, you are encouraged to attend.*
