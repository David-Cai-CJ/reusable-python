# Plan, Part 2: Python Packages

### Topics

* why build and install a python package?
* writing a simple setup.py
* installing your module with setup.py
* importing, using your installed module
* sys.path, PYTHONPATH, PATH
* composing a package: modules, dirs, and init files
* installing a python package with setup.py and pip
* importing, using your installed python package
* upload your package to PyPI
* what is pip?

### What is a Package?

* one or more modules bundled together
* top level init file
* subdirectories and scope
* more init files, imports
* setup.py

### Why Create Packages?

* same reasons as for python modules!
* code reuse and modular programming
* debugging and isolation/locating problems
* collaboration, division of labor
* communication, structured thought structured code
* unit testing, units to test
* integration, well defined interfaces

### Roadmap

1. write a module file
2. write a setup.py
3. install a module, sys.path
4. write init files and subdirs
5. install a package with setup, pip
6. share a package with PyPI


### Write a setup.py

* writing a simple setup.py
* import setuptools
* parts of a setup.py file

### Install a Module

* installing your module with setup.py
* importing, using your installed module
* sys.path, PYTHONPATH, PATH

### Compose a Package

* create a package folder
* add two module files
* create a `__init__.py` file
* optionally create subdirs with init file, module file

### Install a Package

* writing a setup.py for a package
* listing the modules
* installing a python package with setup.py
* importing your installed python package

### Sharing a Package

* what is pip?
* installing with pip
* upload your package to PyPI
